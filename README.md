# Automatic Reporting System
A program allowing for the quick creation of reports and an all in one software package for engineers dealing with machine
malfunctions. The program features a form for the quick reporting of faults with various machinery. Furthermore artificial
intelligence is used to increase the efficiency of reporting. Speech-to-text systems are used to allow engineers to describe the
problem and the form be automatically filled out and Image-to-text systems are also used to read part numbers. The program
also features text and email communication systems allowing for the engineers to easily contact the head office and a live streaming
feature allowing a video stream to be sent from a phone to the app. This engine was designed and developed by Fraser Love
- me@fraser.love. For more detail into the design and implementation of the engine see the development report under the docs folder.
